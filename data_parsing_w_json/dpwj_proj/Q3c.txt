My main takeaway or more accurately my main affirmation from viewing 
this data is that newspapers are for old people, most of the keywords were 
related to politics and dusty books. I've known this for a long time
so this is not much of an affirmation, but it is cool to see that through data 
I guess. Also two other things that I did notice was how the polarizing nature 
of Trump really made his name dominate media headlines for essentially 4 years
straight (2015-2018), (also, we all know why the Presidential Election of 2016 was talked about so 
much compared to 2012). Also the Coronavirus outbreak really shook the room, 
its number of mentions towered over the rest. 
2020 was such a sad year RIP to all those lost. You never really appreciate how good things
are until they change :(


There's an interesting sudden drop off circa. 2012 in the number of top sports 
found as keywords in NYT news articles I think is mainly because sports fanbases 
began getting younger and or more used to getting sports info from blogging sites 
and different social media outlets like twitter and youtube, NYT magazine was
probably too slow to take up the market share in online sports reporting.
