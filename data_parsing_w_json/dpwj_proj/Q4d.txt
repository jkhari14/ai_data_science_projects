Q4a vs Q4a-dt:

Trumps highest volume of deleted tweets seemed to be consitent with Trumps highest volume hours of tweeting, with
the exception of around the 16-20 hour period where I guess he was tamer, and took his medication? Idk.

Q4b vs Q4b-dt:

Tweets were pretty uniform throughout the week, roughly 3% were deleted in total it looks like. Slightly more were 
deleted from saturday tweets

Q4c vs Q4c-dt:

In the months leading up to his presidency trump semed to have access to multiple devices from which he would tweet
but soon after he became president, despite his PR team's best efforts to limit his online presence, 
hilariously Trump was able to tweet nonsense at a steadily to exponentially increasing clip. As his volume of tweets rose, so did his 
volume of deleted tweets, and then on that fateful day of 01-06-21, he rallied his minions a.k.a the Proud Crack- *ahem*
I mean Proud Boys to storm the capital, in a surprisingly unprecedented display of modern white privilege. 
Oddly Enough, Trump's account seems to have been quiet ever since, almost like it got deleted or something.
