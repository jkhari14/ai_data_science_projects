There's not really much to say in regards to the popularity of keywords evolving over this 10 year span
The main topic are pretty consistently politics, the arts, and entertainment. If you really wanted to make some commentary
You could say that the New York Time's taste in sports is pretty bland, they only really talk about Baseball and Football two very 
slow paced sports that get frustrating to watch pretty quickly, 90% of the time for football 2000% of the time for baseball.
Also, they really love talking about the President, Obama was top headliner for three straight years after his presidency and Trump was right up there as well during his presidency
The exception here being Joe Biden though now that I think about it. Not a very interesting person though so thats understandable.
Of course Coronavirus as well has dominated the charts since 2020. I guess you could say this program is a great way to keep up
with MAJOR MAJOR american/global events.
